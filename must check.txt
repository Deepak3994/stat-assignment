While reporting
================

- Whether the outcomes variable is ordinal (median)
- whether there are extreme values or outliers (median)
- If there are no outliers (mean,median)
    -If both are in favour of mean check if observations a normally distributed


What is outlier?

outlier:
 Q3 + 1.5*(IQR)
 Q1 - 1.5*(IQR)
 symbol used is circle

Extreme observations:
 Q3 + 3*(IQR)
 Q1 - 3*(IQR)
 symbol used is star


-boxplot
-densityplot

If it is normally distributed then -> parametric test (indepent, paired, anova)
If it is not normally distributed then -> non-parametric test (two-sample wilconx, paired-sample wilconx, kruskal)
